This repository contains the Rust code to interface with OpenSHMEM.

The top-level "do-gen" script parses an OpenSMHEM header file and
generates dervied Rust equivalents.  Note this is pretty raw output
and is not something that Rust programmers would want to see.  The
do-gen output goes into the "shmemlib" irectory, which forms the
low-level unsafe interface to OpenSHMEM.

The "shmem" directoriy builds on shmemlib and implements Rust code
that hides all the unsafe operations that result from parsing the C.
Or at least, this is the idea, and where the work will be.

The other directories are example programs to explore how to actually
use OpenSHMEM with Rust and to see what the interface should look
like.

The examples are adapted mostly from the C programs in:
